## Django - A web app - Deploy to Azure app servcie web apps - Architecture and Code


Provide architecture and impliment the django appliction for migrating to Azure web apps PasS services. The aplication in scope has been implimented with django verion 1.6 with python 2.7 

### 1. *Business Requirements*

1. The Application must serve variable amount of traffic. Most users are active during business hours. During big
events and conferences the traffic could be 4 times more than typical.
2. The Customer takes guarantee to preserve your notes up to 3 years and recover it if needed.
1. The Customer ensures continuity in service in case of datacenter failures.
2. The Service must be capable of being migrated to any regions supported by the cloud provider in case of
emergency.
5. The Customer is planning to have more than 100 developers to work in this project who want to roll out
multiple deployments a day without interruption / downtime.
6. The Customer wants to provision separated environments to support their development process for
development, testing, production in the near future.
7. The Customer wants to see relevant metrics and logs from the infrastructure for quality assurance and
security purposes.

### 2. *Current State Architecture* 

### 3. Migrating to Azure

Notejam is developed with python 2.7 and django 1.6. Keeping business interests and cost optimization, We have 
three cloud migration strategies availble. This strategy furtehr can be divided into the short , medium and  long term 
cloud migration strategies. These are below

###     3. a.  Short term:

 #### Lift and shift or Rehost: 

Bring all the servers such as appliction and DB server and rehost them in cloud matching to IaaS VMs. We can migrate quickly and easily without much effort as this doesnt require any changes to the appliction.

Compute: Provison Virtual machines for application and database in multiple availabilty zones with auto sacling and
Azure disater reovery to another region for failover and failback. 
    
####    Advantandages:
        
1. This stretegy involves very less effort and easy to realise cloud capabiites such as auto scaling to scale based on  demand requirements
2. Azure Disster recovery for any data center failures and failover to another region
3. Its quick and easy. No changes needed in appliction or investment needed for upgrade of app to latest version
    
####    Disadvantages: 
  
1. Doesnt offer most cost savings as we need to pay for the virtual machines and comparing to other methods explained below, this is less cost effective
2. More responsibilties are with client - infrastructure maintence like patching, backup, security an drecovering      machines during failures 
3. Does not take full advantage of the cloudâ€”legacy applications are not scalable and do not allow for distributed workloads like cloud-native applications do.

###     3. b.  Medium Term: 

####    Infrastructure refactoring

Compute ( Infra refactoring) : Azure provides app services for web applictaions which supports Quickly build, deploy, and scale web apps and APIs on your terms. it Work with .NET, .NET Core, Node.js, Java, Python or PHP, in containers or running on Windows or Linux. Azure supports Python version 3 running on windows or Linux. So to realise the medium term option and it web apps cabailites of Azure app servcies, this app need to be dockerised and deployed. 

####    Advantages:

1. Built-in CI/CD integration and zero-downtime deployments
2. Fully managed platform with built-in infrastructure maintenance, security patching, and scaling based on usage metrics such as HTTP queue, length, data io, memory and CPU usage 
3. Rigorous security and compliance, including SOC and PCI, for seamless deployments across public cloud, Azure Governmentand on-premises environments
4. Achieve high availability with SLA-backed uptime of 99.95 percent
5. Protect your applications with Web App Firewall and connect with virtual network integration
6. DTAP ( Development, Testing, Acceptence and Production) - support with slots. Test on production grade and deploy 
7. Lot of easy configurable options such as Appliction gatewey, appliction insights and log analytics
8. Very cost effective

####    Disadvantages: 

1. Its shared environemnt and many other applications run on these servers 
2. Need to containarise this app as the current python verion is not supported and involves some effort. 

###     3. c.  Long Term:

Sunsetting Python version 2: January 1, 2020, was the day that Python 2 was sunset and no longer supported hence the code need to be upgraded to Python 3. Its good to invest in upgrading the code and migrating to app services. This can be planned after implimenting the medium term cloud startegy as explained above. 

### *Cloud Migration strategy*

Based on the above analysis and realizing best return on investment and considering the the pros and cons, availability of the time, I feel the best option would be to go first for cloud migration strategy for medium term and then move the cloud journey to long term strategy to reliase full benifits. Azure is selected as public cloud provider.

#### 1. _Front Door_: 

Routes incoming requests to the primary region. If the application running that region becomes unavailable, Front Door fails over to the secondary region. it also provides below capabilities and more. This is needed to meet requirment #3 from business requirements. 

       1. Intelligent health probe 
       2. URL-path based routing for requests.
       3. Cookie-based session affinity
       4. SSL offloading and certificate management

Configure front door to route all the traffic to primary region and route to secondary region if primary region fails. Use health probe to check avaialbilty of the backend.

#### 2. _Multi Region deployment_: 

Active and passive failover: We create two app servcie plans in two regions,one in active region - with P1V2 plan which serves the users and another standrad app servcie plan in paired region which will be used and fail over to by front door when active region/data center fails. 

#### 3. _Cross Region Read replica - PostgreSql_

Fully managed and intelligent Azure Database for PostgreSQL. Scale your workload quickly with ease and confidence. Enjoy high availability with up to 99.99% SLA and a choice of single zone or zone redundant high availability.

configure cross-region replicationan for scenarios like disaster recovery planning. This configuration helps in meeting the requirement #3 

#### 4. _Auto Scaling_:

As per the requirement the application need to serve variable demand. Configure P1V2 App servcie plan in primary region which is cost effetive and can auto scale to 20 instances. This app service offers to configure auto scaling based on many matrics. 

#### _Rule - CPU usage - Increase instance_: if CPU usage goes up beyond 70% average, add one more instance.
#### _Rule - CPU Usage - Decrease Instance_: if CPU usage goes down beyond 30% average, add decrease instance by one.

#### 5. _Deployment Slots_:

P1V2 provides deployment slots. We Configure three deployment slots one for development, testing, production. this meets the requirement #6

#### 6. _Appliction Insights_:

Used to monitor your live applications. It will automatically detect performance anomalies, and includes powerful analytics tools to help you diagnose issues and to understand what users actually do with your app. It's designed to help you continuously improve performance and usability. This will ensure the quality assurence for appliction which is part of requirement #7 

Metrics Explorer for aggregated data: 

Explore, filter, and segment aggregated data such as rates of requests, failures, and exceptions; response times, page load times.

#### 7. _Azure Adviser_ 

To quickly and easily optimize your Azure deployments, Azure Advisor analyzes your configurations and usage telemetry and offers personalized, actionable recommendations to help you optimize your Azure resources for reliability, security, operational excellence, performance, and cost. This helps in realizing the requiremnt for the security part of the requiremnt # 7


#### 7. _Backup_

 Configure Azure Backup for longterm rention policy which is easy and cost effective. This is needed to meet the requiremnt #2 

 We have the remaing requirement which is not met is the provion to work 100 plus developers with 100 plus deployments. 

## Infrastructure Deployment

To migarte to cloud we need to provion the infrastructure such as app service plans, apps, data bases and monitoring services. 

Propsing Azure Devops as devops infrastructure and Azure as cloud provider

Use CLI and resource manager temaplates to quickly deploy the infra structure in azure. Please see below infrastructure components.

![Image of Deployment](images/App%20Service%20Deployment-Infra%20Deployment.png)

#### 1. _Container Registry_ 

Create and maintain Azure container registries to store and manage private Docker container images and related artifacts. Use premium SKU to support encryption of the images. Base and stanadrd doesnt support the encryption. 

#### 2. *App Service Plan* 

Create appservcie plan P1V2 and app service under it. 

#### 3. *PostgreSql*

Deploy single server postgreSql server in availble region where app is hosted. 

#### 4. *Log Analytics,Appliction Insights and Storage account*

Create Log analytcis, appliction insights and storage account. Azure adviser is a default servcie and which helps in monotring cost, performance and security.

## Devops - 

Continuous deployment is a key feature for many fast-moving organizations. They need to deploy the latest version of their software quickly, but with the minimum of fuss. This specified as requirement #5 to support multiple developers and deployments a day


![Image of DevOps](images/App%20Service%20Deployment-%20Devops-CICD.png)


#### 1. *Configure ACR Task*

It provides cloud-based container image building for platforms including Linux, Windows, and ARM, and can automate OS and framework patching for your Docker containers. 

Configure ACR task to build image whenver there is a change/commit in source code which automtaically built an image. We use trigger on source code update and which stored in Azure repos

#### 2. Webhook


Azure App Service supports continuous deployment using webhooks. We configure App servcie  applications to subscribe to the webhook to receive notifications about updates to images in the registry and pull the latest image to the app automatically and restart the site in predefined slot such as developmen
